folder that you specify.  First it looks for chapters and then creates a
folder per chapter if one doesn't already exist.  Then it compares mp4
files in the folder path you specified and if it finds a match renames
it to the title it pulled from the website.  Looks for all files in folder
and subfolders and moves title files to their correct chapter folders.
After that is done Folders with no files in them are cleared up.
 
.PARAMETER FolderPath
